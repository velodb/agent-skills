## Dynamic Partition for Automated Data Lifecycle

**Impact: HIGH — Automates partition creation and TTL-based data cleanup.**

Key properties:
- `time_unit`: DAY, WEEK, MONTH
- `start`: Negative number = how many units to keep (TTL). E.g., `"-7"` keeps 7 days.
- `end`: Positive number = how many future partitions to pre-create
- `buckets`: AUTO or fixed number per partition

```sql
PROPERTIES (
    "dynamic_partition.enable" = "true",
    "dynamic_partition.time_unit" = "DAY",
    "dynamic_partition.start" = "-7",
    "dynamic_partition.end" = "3",
    "dynamic_partition.prefix" = "p",
    "dynamic_partition.buckets" = "AUTO"
);
```

**Warnings:**
- Do not use dynamic partition for tables with < 20 million rows. Creates wasteful empty partitions.
- **Do NOT combine with AUTO PARTITION.** If using `AUTO PARTITION BY RANGE`, do not add `dynamic_partition.*` properties — they are redundant and conflict. AUTO PARTITION handles partition creation on data arrival. For TTL cleanup, use a scheduled `ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION` job instead.
